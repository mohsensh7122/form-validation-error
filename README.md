## Form Input Validation

### Intro

To craft web experiences that are accessible to all users, reach the largest possible audience, and are in compliance with web regulations, it’s important to consider the needs of users with disabilities when presenting content. Some users require the help of assistive technologies like screen readers, and others aren’t able to recognize prompts that are indicated by color changes alone.  Here’s some lightweight practice with creating custom form input validation error indications.  You’ll use JavaScript to create a pair of custom functions that update the styles and UI to indicate whether a required form field is valid or not.  And then you'll conditionally call those functions inside of three provided validation functions that preform the actual testing.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.  If you don't know how to do that, please reach out in Slack.  Next, follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  When you are done, trying to submit the form without correctly filling it out will result in clear form input validation error indications.

If you get stuck or have questions, reach out to your Slack team.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
